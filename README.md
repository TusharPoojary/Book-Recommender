# Book Recommender System

During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.
In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).

This is an end to end project on Book recommender system based on collaboraative filter based method to display books as per their ratings and to display top 50 books. Web application is built for this book recommender system using Flask in PyCharm platform and this web application is deployed in Heruko.
